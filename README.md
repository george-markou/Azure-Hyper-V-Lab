# Azure Hyper-V Lab

Hey everyone üëã

Introducing an Azure IaaS VM Deployment Template for Windows Server 2022 with Hyper-V Role enabled. This template simplifies the process, allowing you to harness the power of Hyper-V for experimentation, learning, proof of concept development, non-production environments, or even as a staging environment for creating custom images destined for Azure's public cloud.

Here's what's included in the template:

+ A Virtual Network (VNet) with one Subnet
+ A Static Public IP with Standard SKU
+ A Network Security Group (NSG) configured to enable Remote Desktop Connections
+ A Virtual Machine with Nested Virtualization capabilities - visit Markou.me for more information
+ Two Premium SSD Disks: one for the Operating System (127GB) and one for Storing Virtual Machines (512GB)

üåê Server Roles:

+ Hyper-V
+ DHCP Server
+ RSAT Tools
+ Containers

üì¶ Additional Software Pre-Installed:

+ Azure Az PowerShell module
+ Azure CLI
+ Azure Storage Explorer
+ AzCopy Utility
+ PowerShell Core
+ Windows Admin Center
+ 7-Zip
+ Chocolatey Package Manager

## General Notes

+ There is a large list of VM sizes specified as allowed values within the Template. Just to make your life easier and avoid deployment errors :superhero:.
+ The virtual machine is utilizing Azure Spot Instances instead of regular instances, and an eviction policy has been set to 'deallocate'.
+ To evaluate Microsoft Software and Operating Systems, use the Desktop Shortcut of the Microsoft Evaluation Center.
+ In order to use Azure Marketplace Images to deploy Virtual Machines, visit my [blog](https://www.markou.me/2022/03/use-azure-marketplace-images-to-deploy-virtual-machines-on-azure-stack-hci/).
+ The default path for storing Virtual Machine configuration files is "F:\VMS" and for disks is "F:\VMS\Disks".
+ Enhanced Session Mode is set to Enabled.
+ A DHCP Scope is present, providing Network Addressing to Virtual Machines.
+ An Internal Hyper-V Switch that is Nat enabled is present.
+ The Data Disk (Volume F) is formatted with ReFS and unit size 64KB.
+ You will find both JSON and Bicep Templates within this repo.
+ The DSC Configuration File is listed here [here](dsc/DSCInstallWindowsFeatures.ps1).
+ The Host Configuration File is listed here [here](/HostConfig.ps1).
